# The 'kpshift' map behaves as a function-modifier for the 'key-pad' layer.
# When held, pressing keys will generate their key-pad mode mapping instead
# of their normal mapping.
# A quirk is that you have to map both the normal version and the key-pad
# version of the key that you want to behave as a modifier.
