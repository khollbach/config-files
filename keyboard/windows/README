You must download "Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator" to use the `.klc` file.

This was surprisingly easy to do; I took this approach from `https://github.com/bradfeehan/Dvorak-QWERTY-Ctrl`. See the instructions there for how to install -- it's quite simple.

To map capslock to control, right-click the `.reg` file and click on "merge". It will take effect once you reboot.
