These are my notes about how I've configured "The New Pok3r RGB"
from Vortex Keyboard.

Switch layers with Fn + M,./  The first layer is always "default",
and the other 3 are customizable. There's a red, green, or blue LED
that shows when you're on customizable layer 1, 2, or 3.

Swap Fn and Pn keys on all 3 customizable layers. To do this, first
select a layer and then flip DIP switch 4. The backlights will guide
you. Flip the DIP switch back after each layer.

To map keys other than Fn and Pn, select a layer and then press Fn+RCtrl
to toggle edit mode. When in edit mode, press a single "source" key (or
Fn + a single key), and then press one or more "target" keys to map to;
then press Pn. Repeat as needed, pressing Pn between each mapping.
When you're done, exit edit mode with Fn+RCtrl.

Layer 1 (red LED):
Esc -> Fn Esc (which generates `)
Caps -> Esc
Fn Caps -> Esc

Layer 3 (blue LED):
Esc -> Fn Esc (which generates `)
Caps -> LCtrl
Fn Caps -> LCtrl
LCtrl -> Esc
Fn LCtrl -> Esc
