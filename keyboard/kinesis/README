These files are keymaps that can be put on the Kinesis Advantage 2's on-board drive.

For more info, see:

TLDR:
- progm+Shift+Escape => "super-user" mode on/off
- progm+F1 			 => mount/unmount on-board drive (requires super-user)
- Copy the keymap file to the `active/` directory, named `1_qwerty.txt`.
- progm+F3 			 => activate qwerty
- progm+1 			 => activate the custom keymap
(For the first two commands, the lights will flash three times for "on"/"mounted", and twice for "off"/"unmounted".)

See also the KA2 manual. Check the appendix for a diagram of the keycodes (names of the keys) for remapping.
