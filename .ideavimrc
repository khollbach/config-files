" This is a workaround for the following issue: The "Run" action causes focus
" to be *nowhere*, which causes the "FocusEditor" action to just not work.
" (This means you can't hit Escape to re-focus the editor after you Run.)
"
" To fix it, put this in `~/.config/JetBrains/CLionYYYY.N/options/macros.xml`,
" and bind one of them to Escape. (Don't unbind other meanings of Escape.)
