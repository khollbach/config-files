Upgrade python3-neovim version, for deoplete. The following should work:

If you want capslock to be control in virtual consoles, add to /etc/rc.local:
    (dumpkeys | head -1; echo keycode 58 = Control) | loadkeys -
and make sure the file is executable and has the header #!/bin/bash
On Windows, set system env var HOME to "C:\Users\$USERNAME" so Emacs can find
