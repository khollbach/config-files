Vim plugins to try:

LSP support:
    ale and coc

tagbar

Completion (if not good enough via ale/coc/vim-go etc):
    YouCompleteMe

LSP?
    syntastic

ctrlp vs fzf, vim-fzf ???

ag.vim vs ack.vim vs etc etc...
    (vs :grep ???? see also :Ggrep)

# TODO: get this to work.
#git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim

# TODO:
# Try out fzf instead of ctrlp.
# Look into ale (and maybe later syntastic).
# Try out tagbar or taglist. (<leader>t)
# Try out vim-plug (or another plugin manager).

TODO: clean up deoplete section of vimrc, and either
debug deoplete, or get a new completion plugin.

Why does the main split's filename disappear when I'm focusing the quickfix list?

Consider making a tmux bind for "Break pane into new session"

Vim: nowrap in :Ack
- :Ack workflow in general..

Consider aliasing(?) git diff to ignore $gulp/.generated/
gd -- . ':!.generated'
